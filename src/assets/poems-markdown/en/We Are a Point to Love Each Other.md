# We Are a Point to Love Each Other

You and I
are the minimum expression
of matter
and the maximum expression of the soul...

We are a united point
in the universe
like all beings, an atom
elevated to its maximum expression:
the brain (I call it, the soul).
And we join by points (atoms)
within a space
and we evolve traversing that space
between one point and another point...making
in this way, time.

And in that time
we have met
by taste and by chemistry...
without finishing knowing each other...

But I already love you, for you are the point
most beautiful and attractive
that I have found
in time and space
where your soul
has given me
your loving smile.
And in that space we traverse
in the translation
and rotation of time, there will be
spaces to give ourselves
more love, more freedom,
more democracy, and
more equality
