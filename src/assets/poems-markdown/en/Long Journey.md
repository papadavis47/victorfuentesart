# Long Journey

## 1

I don't know if someday you'll realize that arrow
of infinite journey, launched by cupid, that pierced my
already old heart...

## 2

Long journey from the tropic of the Sacuanjoche passing
through the savannas of Kilimanjaro, until reaching the point of
departure among the cold pine forests.
Impossible the accuracy of that arrow that passed far
from your heart.

## 3

Kisses of love bubbles that extinguish
in the moment of that passion that your lips
provoke in me, trembling
ardent......but

## 4

It's not the center of the target where
my soul dwells, which
bows before you for a longing of warm
love. The point is that

## 5

you could extinguish from my soul the loneliness
and sadness, intertwining your soul and mine with the joy
and dance of the Blackberries, the sunflowers
and the song of birds in flight!
