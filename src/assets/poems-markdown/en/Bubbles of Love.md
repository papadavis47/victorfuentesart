# Bubbles of Love

Upon your cinnamon-skinned hands
at the breath of your mouth
your kisses travel in bubbles of love,
that vanish over the roses
that adorn your steps.

The prisms of lights in the drops
of rainwater
that spill like sequins
of multiple colors
that fall from the light-dark sky,
the leaves of the pine trees
bathe your angelic figure that quickly crosses
the edge of my reality
to the illusion in bubbles of love.
