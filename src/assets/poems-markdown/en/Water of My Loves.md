# Water of My Loves

Water of my loves
you are me
I am you.

Clocks of the eccentric
Dalí, bent
over gloomy branches
of fallen trees,
measure your existence.

Bodies of pure water
and living blood
are extinguished
by the ambition
of man.

Desperate screams,
raging with thirst, echo
over scattered bones
and deaf ears.
