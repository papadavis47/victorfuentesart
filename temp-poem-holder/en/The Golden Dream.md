# The Golden Dream
(Song)

I have a dream in the kitchen
that rests in your hands...
It's a golden dream
so big and beautiful
and I want to share it with you.

I have a dream in the kitchen,
it's golden and delicious.
It has the shape of a heart
and with the taste of love.

I cooked it in the oven
with organic ingredients of
love and affection.

A barrel of love, affection and understanding

A barrel of your laughter and spring smiles

A big piece of the universe with its summer
suns

A full moon of romance in an October
sunset

A barrel of bee honey that sweetens
your queen's heart

A cask of red wine from a cold winter

½ barrel of good humor with a little
hot chile from summer

I have a dream in the kitchen
that rests in your hands,
it's a golden dream
so big and beautiful
and I want to share it with you...
