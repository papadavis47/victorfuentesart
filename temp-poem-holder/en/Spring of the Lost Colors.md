# Spring of the Lost Colors

From mistakes I am learning,
said the bumblebee that fell from its flight
and drifted on the river,
with its broken wings
and its face full of pollen that
barely transformed into honey for
its survival...

Nature is also like this...
that's why with time the branch broke
that held the joy of those
marvelous flowers.

My hands are eternally grateful
for the aromas of the spring flowers
that supported the bees
so they could fly to other suns
in search of their destiny.
