# Images of Love

1

I don't know how to imagine you, love...your name someone
invented...
Since then no one has been able to define your face and I
since childhood
wanted to see you.

2

I always wanted to look at your face, love,
thinking you would come around the corner
when the sun rose in the east.
I searched for you everywhere and could not see you;
people spoke, hated and cried in your name,
smiled and shouted, sometimes without reason.

It was in my adolescence when I thought I saw your image
in the wind-blown hair of the girls in my neighborhood
and in their mouths that let escape sighs of rose,
in their laughter and smiles, in the joys and sorrows
and in those tears wiped away by their little hands
soft and loving

4

It was at the setting of the sun, where dreams are consumed
in my gray hair, to emerge in the passionate gazes
of the muses and the fierceness of the Centaurs and in the songs
of the Sirens, lovers of Poseidon, that I saw your face
in the immensity of the Universe...
