"The intention of my painting is to project Latin American art and culture through themes from my Latin roots. In this context, the goal of my work is to transmit my knowledge, sensibility, and love of art to the different cultures in Washington State. In this sense, visual art has been my greatest connection with the Pacific Northwest, where the various cultures allow me to learn from them and thereby enrich my artwork, liberating my brush toward new expressions and colors. I believe art lives within each one of us, and it seeks a universe of forms and colors that enriches humanity and touches the spirit."
